# My Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I have worked on during my 1.5 years of education at INSEA (National Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics). The projects span various domains including Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Web Scraping.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a field I am passionate about and have been exploring through several projects. The `Reinforcement learning` folder contains implementations and experiments related to RL algorithms and techniques.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

In the `NLP` folder, you will find a selection of Natural Language Processing projects I have worked on. These projects demonstrate my experience in applying NLP techniques to solve real-world problems. Please note that the projects included here are the ones I have permission to share publicly on GitHub.

## Computer Vision (CV)

The `Computer vision` folder showcases my work in the field of Computer Vision. It includes projects that involve tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more. These projects highlight my ability to apply CV algorithms and frameworks to various applications.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ML and DL)

Inside the `ML and DL` folder, you will find a collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects. These projects tackle interesting real-world use cases and demonstrate my proficiency in applying ML and DL techniques to solve complex problems.

## Web Scraping and Automation

The `Scrapping and automation` folder contains projects related to web scraping and automation. I have utilized web scraping techniques to gather data required for various projects and automated repetitive tasks to streamline workflows.

Feel free to explore each project folder to learn more about the specific implementations, methodologies, and results achieved. Each project includes its own README file with detailed information and instructions.
