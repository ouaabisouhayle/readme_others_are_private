## Projects

### Reinforcement Learning
#### Custom Environment Projects
- **Truck Packing**: Developed an RL agent to optimize the packing of items into a truck, maximizing space utilization and efficiency.
- **Trading Actions**: Created an RL environment to simulate trading scenarios and trained agents to make profitable trading decisions.

#### OpenAI Gym Environments
- **CartPole**: Implemented and compared various RL algorithms, including Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and Double DQN (DDQN), to solve the CartPole balancing problem.
- **CarRacing**: Developed an RL agent using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn optimal control strategies for the CarRacing environment.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
#### NLP Classification on Rotten Tomatoes
- **Basic NLP Classification**: Implemented text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction. Applied machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for text classification.
- **LSTM and Deep LSTM Models**: Utilized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture sequential information in movie reviews. Experimented with different LSTM architectures to improve classification performance.

#### PEFT: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for LLMs
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques**: Investigated various PEFT techniques such as adapters, prefix tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Implemented and compared different PEFT methods to identify the most effective approach.
- **Resource Optimization**: Analyzed the trade-offs between fine-tuning efficiency and model performance. Optimized the fine-tuning process to reduce computational requirements without significant performance degradation.

#### Customer Request Classification
- Designed and developed an advanced classification model to analyze customer requests, enabling automated and personalized responses using NLP techniques, TensorFlow, and deep learning approaches.

### Langchain Projects
#### Data Analyst Chatbot
- **CSV Agent with Langchain**: Developed a chatbot that can interact with and analyze data stored in CSV files using Langchain’s agents and tools.
- **SQL Agent with Langchain**: Created a chatbot that can interact with databases using SQL queries through Langchain’s SQL agent.
- **Deep SQL Chain with Langchain**: Built a SQL agent from scratch using Langchain’s components and abstractions, implementing a deep learning model to generate SQL queries based on user input.

#### Financial Market Decision Support Chatbot
- Developed a RAG-based chatbot to assist financial market professionals in decision-making, processing complex PDF documents containing text, images, and tables using LangChain, FAISS, Unstructured, and Embeddings.

### Computer Vision and Machine Learning
#### Multimodal Multilabel Disease Classification
- Created a multimodal multilabel classification model to predict diseases from textual data and radiographic images using PyTorch, computer vision techniques, and NLP.

#### Movie Recommendation System
- Designed an innovative movie recommendation system employing collaborative filtering techniques to offer personalized suggestions using TensorFlow and Pandas.

#### Tennis Padel Stroke Classification
- Developed a model integrated into a wearable device to classify tennis strokes in real-time based on multi-axis sensor data using TensorFlow and signal processing techniques.

### Time Series Forecasting
#### Birth Forecasting
- Forecasted child births in all provinces of Spain using LSTM networks and TensorFlow, applying time series analysis and forecasting techniques.

### Web Scraping and Data Analysis
#### Scraping and Analysis of Territorial (US) and Sports Data
- Developed an automated system for collecting and analyzing data on sports camps and demographic data through web scraping using Python. Processed and analyzed information contained in PDFs using LangChain and language models (LLMs), and automatically generated detailed reports in PDF format with LaTeX.
